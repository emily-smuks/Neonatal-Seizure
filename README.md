# Neonatal-Epilepsy
Provided in this repository is the code for a personalized Monte Carlo Simulation. The code was used in order to identify the importance of different controllable risk factors in terms of neonatal seizures. These risk factors include smoking, alcohol, opioids, and SSRIs. 
MaybeEpilepticBaby.py is the "base" code for this simulation, using the original values found during the literature review. 
Simulate_babies.py codes for a number of experiments that alter the probabilities used in MaybeEpilepticBabe.py. In order to maintain a simplified code, all unchanged probabiltiies were not mentioned in the experiments. Additionally, each experiment has a small explanation  attached of any changes. 
For further analysis of this simulation, please refer back to the paper.
